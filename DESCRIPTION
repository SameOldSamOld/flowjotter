Description: 
    This package is designed to be a time-saving tool for researchers working with High Dimensional Flow Cytometry datasets.
    Flow Jotter is used for quickly jotting flow cytometry data exported from FlowJo to Excel after gating.
    It reads uploaded tabular .xlsx files with specifically formatted column names to specify Number, Percentage, or MFI plots.
    It uses a shiny app GUI to visualise and customise plots from data that is uploaded to it.
    Once plots are customised, multiple plots can be downloaded as large .ppt or .pdf files.
    Conversion to prism format is also available for researchers who intend to use prism graphing/statistical software.
